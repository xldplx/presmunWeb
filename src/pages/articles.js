      content: `UNDP: During the first session of the UNDP council
at PRESMUN 2025, delegates began discussions on
the root causes and impacts of gentrification. Countries
like Ethiopia and Tunisia gave strong statements in the
opening session.

Ethiopia opened their speech in a unique way, saying “skibidi toilet sigma” to catch attention,
before explaining that gentrification is about “kicking out the poor” because of rising rent prices.
They pointed out that this issue starts from the growing gap between rich developers and poor
residents. This statement was later echoed by delegates from China, Romania, Nigeria, and Ireland,
who all agreed that gentrification is an important global issue that must be addressed through
international cooperation and urban policy reform.

The council also talked about how gentrification affects minority communities. Tunisia shared that
their country works to ensure urban development is fair for all citizens. “We once collaborated
with UN-Habitat and applied SDG 11 to help cities grow without sacrificing people’s lives,”
Tunisia added.

UNDP delegates agreed that cities need better planning that listens to the people. Countries are
working together to create fair policies that prevent forced relocation, protect minorities, and
support sustainable development.

As PRESMUN continues, Arab News will follow more discussions and highlight solutions from
the global leaders.`

      content: `The UNDP of PRESMUN 2025 goes into a frenzy to try to address all factors of
gentrification, albeit being controlled, delegates are rushing into solution-based discussions.
UNDP PRESMUN 2025 (New York Times) – At around 9:00 AM (Western Indonesian
Time), delegates of the UNDP PRESMUN 2025 rush to find solutions in the council. During
the opening, many delegates had a uniform ‘call to action’, which is the call to action of unity
in proposing an economic stance in solving gentrification.

The topic of displacement was repeatedly brought up during the opening speeches.
Displacement of the lower class was the main topic of concern, leading to many delegates
pledging to find economic ways to not only reduce the impact of gentrification within
neighborhoods, but also find ways to increase the quality of life within lower-class
neighborhoods.

Delegates pitched in on already-made resolutions, such as point 11 of the SDGs was brought
up by the delegate of the United Kingdom. The delegate of Ireland proposed an ‘Urban
Development Quota’ where some areas are imposed a cap on the use of land. This quota will
help with efficiency whilst helping to reduce the amount of money that can be used for
gentrification.

At 10:08 am, an unmoderated caucus was agreed upon, so the delegates went around the
chamber, coming together to form different blocs. One was seen to be spearheaded by the
delegation of the United States, and the other by the delegation of Nigeria. A split of blocs
was agreed upon to focus on tackling gentrification based on the economic capability of each
country.

All and all, the UNDP council was hectic, many delegates came together to find a way to
tackle all factors of gentrification; however, in the end, the delegates understood it was better
to focus on tackling and limiting gentrification, based on each country’s economic capability.

      content: `The United States proposed the Community Land Trust (CLT) model during today’s UNDP
Council session as a response to the growing displacement of urban populations in
developing countries. The proposal was particularly highlighted during discussions with
Tunisia, where both delegations exchanged perspectives on inclusive and equitable urban
development.

The CLT model, originally developed in the United States, is designed to prevent real estate
speculation by placing land under community ownership. This approach enables long-term
housing affordability and stability for marginalized populations.

The U.S. delegation emphasized the success of CLTs in cities such as Washington, an area
facing significant gentrification pressures and noted that since 2025, the implementation and
impact of CLTs have significantly improved within the U.S. itself.

Tunisia responded positively, expressing openness to adapting similar community-based
models tailored to their local context and indicated their intent to explore the concept further
in upcoming discussions.

This dialogue was part of the UNDP Council’s broader efforts to address the consequences of
gentrification, particularly across the Global South. As urban inequality continues to impact
vulnerable communities worldwide, models like the CLT are gaining attention as potential
tools for sustainable and socially just development.`

actions of climate mitigation. Besides that, small island developing country (SIDS) and Asia-
Pacific countries are also being discussed in the conference.

The delegates said that each country has its own challenge, such as Netherlands that have
been geographically shaped by water, Indonesia as an archipelago country, and Maldives
that are etoll country are concern of the island submerging driven by sea level rise. Therefore,
the solutions must be discussed and considered by the whole country.

In a recent discussion, the delegate of Netherlands mentioned the high-emitting activities,
especially causes by high economies and highlighted the negative impacts that ASEAN and
Pacific country and other SIDS as sea level rise at-risk countries facing. More over, the
delegate of Netherland emphasized the blue economy market and focusing on minimum

      date: "July 19, 2025",
      text: "News Article",
      content: `Long-term changes in weather patterns and temperatures are commonly referred to by the term
climate change. Changes in the sun's activity can cause these changes naturally. These result
from using coal to heat a building or gasoline to power a vehicle. The Earth is warming faster
than it has in at least two millennia due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) under the UN Council focused on the solution
of climate change globally.

In the UNEP meeting simulations, the delegates of any country raise their placard proudly to
propose their solutions. In the Moderated Caucus, the delegates of the Netherlands and delegates
of the United States are active to propose motions to solve these issues. The delegates of the
Netherlands said “Climate Change is in there too. Country allocated below sea level. Always
manage the water with innovations and protect. We need support from all countries to face this
crisis together.” This can be seen as the Netherlands seeking for international cooperations
among countries. In the GSL, the US is saying that the current solutions are not enough, also
need collaboration too. It can be seen that the US mentioned already joining the Paris
Agreement.

Especially in unmoderated caucus, there's such a perspective gap between the delegates of
Netherlands and the delegates of the United States. The US is negotiating that just one bloc
exists and trying to dominate other countries to become one bloc. Because the US delegate thinks
that climate change is the problem of all countries, so all countries must work together in one
block. But the Netherlands and China have a different perspective about making the bloc. The
Netherlands negotiated that there must be another bloc because each country has different
perspectives and problems. Many countries have their own national interests as well.
The UNEP simulation meeting showed contrasting views between the US and the Netherlands,
reflecting challenges in uniting countries with different interests to address climate change
effectively.`

      content: `UNEP's main topic revolves around each member's concern regarding climate change and biodiversity loss. Majority expresses their fear towards the 'sinking' of each nation as the result of prolonged climate change.

The council started off calm in the morning, with Bangladesh kickstarting the GSL. The council's attention is quickly averted towards China's strong speech, demanding the discussion of root causes and loopholes, which then caught the delegate of Netherland's interest in later motion.

USA, however, started to show arrogance once the unmoderated caucus unfolded, with the main topic of root causes, loopholes, and possible solutions. "We believe that everyone is facing the same issue, and that is why we propose for us to be one bloc.", delegate of USA said. This proposal rapidly raises disagreements across the discussion circle, where China steps in for a rebuttal towards USA's statement, along with Netherlands. "It's not effective.", says the delegate of Netherlands.

"Not every country faces the same issue,", China said, "and by putting everyone in the same bloc, it'll be a struggle for us to differentiate each state's problem.". Delegate of Brazil, agreeing with China, added, "We can't fully cut gas emissions, because it occurs daily and the usage ofgas is necessary in today's civilization." Later on, the council split into two respectful groups, EU and G77 members.

The second moderated caucus lead into a more comprehensive discussion, such as the strengthening of global resilience and capacity building assist for developing countries. Delegate of USA, once again, tried to test China's stance (and possibly patience), by criticizing their 'half-hearted' effort on repairing coastal lines, that there has been no significant progress since the start.

"It's pretty difficult to work alongside USA with different economy strategies.", China answered when asked about the possibility of collaboration with USA during an interview.`

      author: "Renata Bahaswar",

      text: "Op-Editorials",
      content: `Indonesia as a country with thousands of islands, mangroves, and rainforests, is in the forefront of
ecological danger as the climate crisis worsens. Climate action is urgently needed because of the
threat that rising sea levels pose to its coastal people and the loss of biodiversity in its most
abundant ecosystems.

However, despite many promises of billions in climate money from international forums, aid to
weaker developing countries like Indonesia continues to be delayed, unequal, and frequently
linked to complex circumstances. This begs the important question of whether global climate
finance systems are indeed intended to assist those in greatest need or if they are instead serving
to exacerbate the very disparities that the climate movement aims to address.

Although billions of dollars in climate finance are frequently promised at international meetings,
the real flow of money to nations like Indonesia is still small. Despite playing a crucial role in
biodiversity and global carbon storage, Indonesia has difficulty getting timely and equitable
support. According to recent interview with the delegate of Indonesia, When it comes to how
accessible climate finance is for Indonesia, the answer is only partially accessible.

It is true that Indonesia has received some funding, such as the Green Climate Fund for some
projects like REDD+ results-based payments in 2019 where Indonesia received 103.8 million USD
for reducing emissions from deforestation. Indonesia also received a lot of aid such as the Forest
Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) from the World Bank, UN-REDD, Norway's NICFI, and
bilateral agreements with Germany, Japan, and others.

Despite they have received the financial aid, it is not enough. For example, FOLU Net Sink
program 2023, one of the main features of which is to address the Jakarta Sinking problem, the
funding needs are around 204 trillion Rupiah (13 Billion USD), but the Indonesian government
funding for the 2020-2024 time period is only around 19.6 trillion, far from the funding needs.
Although Indonesia has received 1 Trillion from Norway under the Results-Based Contribution
(RBC-5), the gap between the required funds and the existing funds is still very large.

Indonesia is among the 35 countries most vulnerable to climate change, with major risks from
rising sea levels, extreme weather and biodiversity loss. Yet so far, Indonesia has received various
types of assistance, but the gap is still very large. It is estimated that Indonesia needs around 281
billion USD to implement its declared NDC. However, current international contributions cover
less than 20% of the need. The delegate said that distribution of climate fund is unfair. Many
developing countries like Indonesia have pledged 100 billion USD per year by 2020, but have
never met these targets in full or on time.`

      content: `UNDP: The world is facing big problems like gentrification and urban displacement. These are
not new issues, but the way we solve them often feels old and slow. In the recent UNDP session,
it became clear that we need something more than just reports and long debates.

One of the main problems discussed in the council was about money. The United States said UNDP
projects cost too much and asked for clear plans. Other countries tried to balance between
economic growth and social equality. But the conversation started to feel stuck, until Norway
changed everything.

In a surprising moment, the delegate of Norway stood up, tore a piece of paper, and said, “Our
time is limited and we need fast solutions.” Then they gave a bold idea: creating something called
“UN POPS” a modern platform to raise money and support from the youth. Norway ended the
speech by saying, “Modern problem, modern solution,” while hitting the table.

This strong move was supported by Tunisia, showing that some countries are ready to try new
ideas. Instead of talking only about slow policies, they want fast action and creative thinking.

Arab News believes that this moment shows something important: diplomacy needs to change. We
are living in a fast world, but many diplomats still act too slow. Some countries like China or the
ones who choose to stay quiet are missing the chance to lead. Saying nothing is not the same as
being wise. Others countries such as U.S, Ireland, and more already shown they can lead with
smart ideas, like Vision 2030 and big urban projects. So why not do the same in diplomacy? We at
Arab News call for fresh solutions. Delegates must stop waiting and start acting. Let’s bring ideas
that are new, exciting, and fast just like the world we live in today.`

the unmoderated caucus. “We’re one great big country,”, USA stated during an interview, “we

delegate’s idea was ‘unrealistic’ and would be a struggle to achieve, due to every country having
more than one problems, and none shares the same two.

Netherlands agreed along with the Eastern, although both eventually split up into EU and G77
member groups.

During the crisis, two of three said countries were alleged with some controversial actions. USA
exporting its waste to developing countries, and Netherlands, being naïve while also facing
homicide allegations of some NGOs chairmen.

USA strengthens its MAGA movement by transporting trash to other countries
“We’re allocating our waste to developing countries so they can manage it, while we focus on
other important matters.”, USA clarified.

When asked for clarification during the press session, USA has shown their primordiality once
again, by saying “no” when asked whether they care or not about the wellbeing of the countries
they exported their waste to. No further clarification were added.

Netherlands, on the other hand, stood up for their Prime Minister as if hiding the truth, or simply
just ignorant. Saying, there has been no concrete proof nor validity of the accused file, as much
as they’re just assumptions.

China seemed subtly calm when two other delegates were fighting for the good sake of their
country. The delegation clarifies, “Not in any way, for now.”, when demanded information
regarding fostering a collaboration with USA, Netherlands, and other EU member countries.

      text: "Op-Editorials",
      excerpt: "Western powers promote housing equity in the Global South while gentrification rages in their cities. Hypocrisy or help?",
      content: `The United States took the stage at the UNDP Council with compelling rhetoric, proposing a
motion titled “The Impact of Gentrification on Minority Communities.” Their solution? The
Community Land Trust (CLT) is a model designed to ensure community land ownership and
resist displacement. The idea, promoted with confidence, was even offered to countries like
Tunisia and Ethiopia as a scalable solution for inclusive urban development. Moreover,
countries like Norway and Japan are also open to this. But behind the façade of progressive
diplomacy lies a disturbing contradiction.

In its cities, the U.S. continues to witness the unchecked displacement of Black, Latino, and
Indigenous communities. Gentrification in urban centers like New York, San Francisco, and
Washington, D.C. has become a symbol of systemic failure, not innovation. Community Land
Trusts, though promising, remain scarce, underfunded, and politically sidelined. How can a
nation export a model that hasn’t yet worked within its borders? This contradiction raises a
deeper question: Is this genuine global solidarity, or another extension of urban
neocolonialism under the flag of development?

The U.S. narrative becomes even more complex when seen through the lens of city
diplomacy and urban transnationalism. Cities are no longer passive arenas of development;
they are actors. They now participate in international policymaking, shape global norms, and,
increasingly, dictate what “progress” should look like in the Global South.

But if urban diplomacy becomes a new mode of influence, who benefits?

In this conference, Ethiopia has openly aligned itself with the U.S. stance. This may seem
like a sign of South–North cooperation. But history urges caution. When dominant powers
offer “solutions,” too often those come with conditions, whether explicit or implicit. Cities in
the Global South may be asked to adopt Western models of development without the power
to negotiate terms that fit their unique sociopolitical realities.

The danger is clear: the Global South could once again become a testing ground for ideas
not fully tested in the Global North. Tunisia, a country still healing from revolutionary
transitions, may soon carry the burden of implementing a model that is not even common in
the country proposing it. If the U.S. truly wants to lead on urban equity, it must begin by
confronting its contradictions. Global leadership cannot be built on unfinished business at
home. Progress begins not in the export of models, but in the humility to learn from one’s
failures.

A "Pop" Solution to a Structural Crisis?

The U.S., along with Norway and Japan, unveiled a joint initiative to create a funding
mechanism backed by what they called UNPOP — a musical and cultural platform aimed at
engaging youth around issues of urban injustice. Norway delegates states that“Modern
problems require modern solutions.”

Engaging youth through culture is admirable. But music does not build affordable housing.
Soundtracks don’t rewrite discriminatory zoning laws. And pop campaigns won’t secure land
rights for informal settlers in Tunis or Addis Ababa. While cultural engagement is important,
cultural diplomacy without structural investment is just rebranding, not reform.`

way to stop floods and protect the land.

Australia focused on protecting the whole ecosystem. They said it is important to keep animals,
plants, and nature safe to fight climate change. One big idea today came from the United States,
who suggested making a Global Blue Fund. This is a plan to give money to countries that want to
fix their oceans and coasts. The idea got support from countries like Australia, Indonesia, and
others.

Philippines delegate explains an initiative with the Netherlands and Brazil to improve climate

especially from a young age is key,” said the delegate of the Philippines. “That’s why we’re

in schools, while also improving early warning systems in vulnerable communities.”

important, it must be accessible to all countries especially those with
limited economic resources. The Ethiopian delegate highlighted that green
technologies often remain unaffordable for developing nations, risking
further inequality. “This cannot become an exclusive solution only
available to the wealthy,” the delegate said, underscoring Ethiopia’s focus
on ensuring that climate action supports local economic development and
protects low-income communities.

The delegate of Ethiopia appeared to challenge the motion not out of
opposition to green energy itself, but due to concerns over equity and
accessibility. The country emphasized that while renewable energy is
essential for sustainable development, many developing nations lack the
financial capacity to implement such solutions. The exchange underscored
the importance of balancing global ambition with national capacities. As

The delegate from Ethiopia said that electric vehicles and other green technologies are often too
expensive and can only be used by rich people. “The eco-friendly measure like using electric
vehicle is not inclusive, mostly only the rich one that can afford it” the delegate said. Ethiopia urge
another countries to think about green solutions that can also help poorer people.

Ireland agreed with this idea, the delegate said that the solutions must be inclusive and not just for
some people. Also for Germany, the country supported community-based solutions, saying that
when local people are involved, the projects work better and include more voices, this makes green
development more equal and accepted.

Slovakia shared their ideas about nature-based solutions, which include using trees, water systems,
and green spaces to help cities. The Slovakia delegate said these solutions have already been
adapted in their country.

Japan also gave strong support for fair access to eco-friendly tools and plans. The delegate warned
that green progress should not isolate or leave out developing countries, and called for equal
sharing of technology and help between rich and poor nations.

After hearing all views, most countries agreed that making cities eco-friendly is important, but it

owned land as an affordable option for housing.

Japan, on the other hand, expressed their want for every delegate to consider eco-friendly options
for urban development.

While there is a difference between green gentrification and green development, both side effects
are not avoidable. That is, in the first motion discussing about ensuring equitable access to eco-
friendly urban development, the delegate of Slovakia stepped in to break their idea of two main
assessments to be considered before planning an urban development scheme, including; natural
aspects, and social aspects.

Confusion sparked as the delegate of Ethiopia grounded their opinion regarding technology
being expensive, rather than ‘inclusive’ for its citizen, “Take example of electric cars, it is really
expensive and requires high-cost maintenance.”, delegate said.

Japan promised a bright future for developing countries, ‘It’s all about technology.’ 
The delegate of Japan stepped in, joining the discussion, saying, “Japan is supporting and willing
to contribute technological distribution to countries in need.”. “Because we believe that
technology should be a bridge, not a barrier.”, they added.

When asked about their plans on the distribution mechanism of the technologies from Japan, the
delegate dropped an answer that left us, highly, in dissatisfaction.

Instead of explaining the specific mechanism, the delegate of Japan, instead, suggested that there
should be cheap housing options that is provided for the original residence.

While we may have recognized the nations concern of the eviction of lower and middle class
eviction from their original resident, Japan, who is often looked towards to, has failed to
elaborate their plans in ensuring equal technological distribution.`

      content: `During today’s PresMUN UNDP conference, many countries talk about how to make eco-friendly
cities and better urban living. One country who come with strong focus on sanitation and
community health is Norway. In the fourth committee session of the conference, the delegate of
Norway suggesting to open a motion about implementation on CLTS from all the countries that
agree with it.

Some developing or last developed countries in the world still lack access to sanitary facilities.
They urinate in the open, close to houses or waterways. This spreads illness and contaminates
water, Women and children suffer the most. This issue was not forgotten by Norway, which is why
they prioritize Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). The goal of CLTS is not to construct a
fancy toilet for public, but to prevent open defecation by uniting communities. People learn to use
what they have to construct basic toilets. They don't only wait for assistance they also alter their
conduct, this is what Norway is in favor of.

Norway has helped with CLTS in places like Africa and Southeast Asia, working with UN agencies
and small local groups. They don’t just give money. They help people lead their own changes. This
is better for long-term progress.

Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1
, which addresses universal access to clean
water and sanitation, is another objective that CLTS supports. The best part is it doesn't require
costly technologies. All that is required is community understanding, trust, and action. Ireland and
Japan were among the nations that offered assistance. They claimed that everyone, not just the
wealthy, should benefit from progress. This covers people who reside in urban and rural areas.

Norway's focus serves as a powerful reminder to this writer that true growth begins with basic
requirements. Although discussing bathrooms may seem straightforward, it has a significant impact on equality, dignity, and health. Norway made a little but impactful message about hygiene
during major discussions about technology and climate change. Other nations should not disregard
this warning.`

      content: `When the UNEP council gathered to talk about rising sea levels and
biodiversity loss, it wasn’t just another meeting with sad facts and big promises. This time,
something real happened: solutions were proposed, funding was discussed, and local communities
were finally put at the center.

From mangroves in Bangladesh to coral reefs in Indonesia, the message was clear: nature-based
solutions work, and we need more of them. Countries like Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia
pushed ideas that focused on saving ecosystems and using them as protection, not just decoration.

But the biggest move came from the creation of the Global Blue Fund (GBF), a UNEP-managed
fund meant to support projects that combine climate action and biodiversity protection. With 40%
of the fund going to small islands and low-income countries, this is a big win for those who are
usually left behind. Still, the work doesn’t stop there. A strong resolution is just a paper if no one
acts on it. It’s easy to write nice goals, but hard to apply them in real cities, with real people, and
real money at stake. That’s why it’s so important that UNEP also included early warning systems,
education, and legal toolkits to help governments actually do something, not just talk.

One thing that stood out during the session was how delegates talked about community
involvement. From local seaweed farmers to indigenous youth, this resolution wasn’t just about
big governments, it was about everyday people too. That’s rare, and it should become the new
normal. We need to hold UNEP and its member states accountable. Will they really send the
money? Will they help local communities? Or will this resolution end up as another fancy PDF in
someone’s inbox?

The climate crisis is not waiting. Sea levels are rising, and people are losing their homes. What
happened in UNEP today gives us hope, but only if the promises become action.`

      text: "Op-Editorials",
      content: `On the last day of
the United
Nations
Development
Programme
(UNDP), as the
final day of the climate negotiations progresses, discussions appear to
be moving toward greater clarity and shared understanding. Delegates
from various countries have become increasingly engaged in
proposing and negotiating solutions aligned with their respective
national interests. Clearer bloc formations have emerged, reflecting
each country's stance and strategic priorities, as efforts continue to find
common ground on climate action.

The United States maintained a prominent role in the final day of
negotiations, continuing to lead an independent bloc while presenting a
series of firm proposals on its climate agenda. During the moderated
caucus on “Ensuring Credible Access to Eco-Friendly Urban
Development,” the delegate from Ethiopia offered a thoughtful
critique, raising concerns over the accessibility of green technologies
for developing nations.

The Criticism from delegate of Ethiopian
The Ethiopian delegate emphasized that while the transition to
renewable energy is important, such solutions must not be limited to
countries with greater financial capacity. “Green energy should not
become an exclusive solution only available to the wealthy,” the
delegate stated, highlighting the concern that many green technologies
remain unaffordable for developing nations. Ethiopia underscored the
need for climate action to support local economic development and
prioritize the needs of low-income communities. The delegate of
Ethiopia appeared to challenge the motion not out of opposition to
green energy itself, but due to concerns over equity and accessibility.
The country emphasized that while renewable energy is essential for
sustainable development, many developing nations lack the financial
capacity to implement such solutions. Ethiopia warned that without
mechanisms for support and inclusion, the transition risks becoming a
solution only available to wealthier nations exacerbating existing
inequalities and leaving vulnerable populations behind.

The delegation of Ethiopia proposed a range of potential solutions
aimed at fostering sustainable economic growth, attracting foreign
investment, and expanding access to affordable housing, particularly in
urban areas most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The
delegate emphasized that economic resilience must go hand in hand
with environmental sustainability, noting that infrastructure
development and housing affordability are critical components of
long-term adaptation strategies. By encouraging inclusive investment
frameworks and community-based approaches, Ethiopia called for
greater collaboration to ensure that developing countries are not left
behind in the global transition toward eco-friendly urban development.`

      text: "Op-Editorials",
      content: `USA, China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique has been accused on some problematic movements in
implementing some approaches to reduce gentrification and its side effects. These spiked
controversies across the media, and the UNDP council chamber itself.

China was alleged of ‘secretive’ movements of using the profit Belt Rout Initiative (BRI), to
commence their own green gentrification within big cities, like Beijing, and Chongqing. The BRI
itself was made by the RRC, to help the development of developing countries by, quote on quote,
hand out funds and technology, enhancing infrastructure and improving life quality.

The article also specified the truth of working conditions one of Mozambique’s plant, spoken up
by its whistleblower, whereas it is tallied as much as 150 people dead from the harsh work
environment, as the result of long and unethical working hours, often 19-20 hours a week.

Investigative teams were missioned to take a look at who has been running these plants, and
turns out, and to a large extent, are owned by the CCP. Moreover, it has been proven that China
is misusing their autonomy in terms of the BRI.

When asked clarification, all of the countries involved had shown their failure to breakdown any
useful information.

Atmosphere rose as USA was ‘pulled and dragged’ inside of the debate. The big, one great
country, accused of persuading two African countries present in the chamber; Ethiopia and
Tunisia.

As written, and assumed, in the published press article, USA is convincing said countries to be
on their side, to simply implement the ‘American way’ of housing and urban development, CLT
for example.

The delegate of USA, visibly being blind and ignorant in terms of addressing these countries
incapability on doing so, stated that, “We’ve been successful, the CLTs. Like New York suburbs,
and Oakland for example.”. Additionally, when questioned about how are they actually willing
to implement and perform CLT in either Ethiopia or Tunisia (mechanisms, schemes, funding
options), they left it, once again, unanswered.

When it comes to Ethiopia and Tunisia, they did not react, nor shed their light on their stance
regarding this issue. Seemingly confused, or, perhaps, just surrendering to their fate of being
USA’s ‘doll’, for their own infrastructure and economical profits to be stolen by USA for their
own good.

After a thorough look at both of UNDP’s released working papers, it is safe to say that none of
the solutions are relevant to one another. But, moreover, we are thriving to see what events and
resolutions will unravel inside the council.`

      title: "UNEP On Fire!",

      excerpt: "The UNEP council is on fire right now after delegates put aside differences to come together and finish, pass, and implement a resolution.",
      content: `Yesterday, the UNEP council faced a crisis that not only halted progress for a resolution but
also split the chamber into two sides. The crisis was concerning the Netherlands’ involvement
in waste disposal and the extortion of CEOs, NGO representatives, and so on.

The Netherlands was accused of disposing of waste on an island in Southeast Asia. Much of
the waste that was promised to be disintegrated was relocated to islands of Southeast Asia.
Not only contradict the Netherlands’ proposals, but they also decrease trust for the country.

A heated argument grew for 2 days; however, somewhere down the line, delegates came
together to set aside their differences and to move on from the crisis temporarily, to focus on
the main goal, which is the resolution.

The secondary of the conference showed optimism. Many of the delegates woke up from
political differences and personal differences to compile a draft resolution. The draft
resolution itself had essence and was structured enough to lay out the steps in order to
implement the resolution itself.

Compared to other draft resolutions, this big bloc’s resolution is more detailed and focused on
answering the questions that need to be answered by the resolution. New solutions were
added, like the ESG investments being used to fund the UNEP’s resolutions, using experts in
the problem’s field and using NGOs specifically for the problem of the UNEP’s resolution
was mentioned to be used as part of the resolution itself.

The UNEP is further getting closer to forming a refined resolution. However, are there
aspects that do need further clarification? Yes. Not every part of the draft resolution had
every aspect needed to fix climate change, rising sea levels, etc. As a matter of fact, the bloc’s
resolution had some key aspects that not only needed to be tweaked, but also questioned, as
some countries might not be able to implement these aspects.

The parts that need to be fixed before passing the resolution will be scrutinised by the Press
Corps. The Press Corps has done an intricate and in-depth analysis of the draft resolution
paper, and thus, the Press Corps will find every minor contradiction, aspects that need more
clarification, and many more.

In a few hours, the Press Corps will be headed to the UNEP to question and scrutinize the
council. Why? In order for the council to get a third perspective on the resolution, giving a
heads up to the bloc on what places needed to be fixed, tweaked, and more clarification. This
way, the resolution will have a complete and well-refined resolution.`

      text: "Op-Editorials",
      excerpt: "The UNEP Conference once again exposed the dominance of rhetoric from developed nations, while the voices of the most affected countries like Indonesia and the Philippines were barely heard.",
      content: `The second day of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) conference once
again revealed the long-standing divide between developed and developing countries:
tensions in discussions on climate financing, the implementation of ESG (Environmental,
Social, and Governance), and the search for long-term sustainable solutions.

However, behind the friendly diplomacy and sweet-sounding statements at the forum,
tensions between major countries remained palpable. The United States questioned
developing countries' reliance on funding without tangible ESG implementation. China,
representing the G77+China, acknowledged the importance of ESG but highlighted the
reality that most developing countries remain heavily dependent on the fossil fuel sector.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands is busy promoting its own technology and offering technical
assistance through access to EU funds.

Although they ultimately stand on the same side and agree on the broad outlines of a joint
solution, it is clear that each party is reluctant to fully acknowledge the other's approach.
Instead of building synergy, they are too busy blaming each other and showcasing their own
successes.

On the other hand, Global South countries have offered various concrete solutions. Indonesia,
for example, is pushing for the establishment of a Global Coastal Resilience Fund and
expanding the BIOFIN initiative, as well as proposing mangrove restoration as a natural
barrier proven to reduce wave energy. These efforts reflect the commitment of developing
countries to not only demand funds but also present adaptive, nature-based solutions.

However, are developed countries truly ready to support without conditions? Or are they
hiding a hidden agenda behind technical promises? The leak of confidential Dutch
government files, which revealed manipulation of NGO funds and pollution activities,
provides strong reasons for developing countries to be more cautious about aid that appears
sweet but may be detrimental.

Ironically, the countries most affected—such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Coral
Triangle regions—are often not given enough space to lead the discussion. This region is not
only home to 75% of the world's coral species but also the livelihood of millions of coastal
residents.

These countries not only have the moral right to speak up louder, but also bring real solutions
from their firsthand experience of facing the climate crisis.

International forums like UNEP should be spaces for empowerment, not stages for
ego-driven competition. Now is the time to flip the paradigm. Listen to those on the front
lines. Don’t just talk about the ocean—listen to those who live near it.`
