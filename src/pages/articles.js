      content: `UNDP: During the first session of the UNDP council
at PRESMUN 2025, delegates began discussions on
the root causes and impacts of gentrification. Countries
like Ethiopia and Tunisia gave strong statements in the
opening session.

Ethiopia opened their speech in a unique way, saying “skibidi toilet sigma” to catch attention,
before explaining that gentrification is about “kicking out the poor” because of rising rent prices.
They pointed out that this issue starts from the growing gap between rich developers and poor
residents. This statement was later echoed by delegates from China, Romania, Nigeria, and Ireland,
who all agreed that gentrification is an important global issue that must be addressed through
international cooperation and urban policy reform.

The council also talked about how gentrification affects minority communities. Tunisia shared that
their country works to ensure urban development is fair for all citizens. “We once collaborated
with UN-Habitat and applied SDG 11 to help cities grow without sacrificing people’s lives,”
Tunisia added.

UNDP delegates agreed that cities need better planning that listens to the people. Countries are
working together to create fair policies that prevent forced relocation, protect minorities, and
support sustainable development.

As PRESMUN continues, Arab News will follow more discussions and highlight solutions from
the global leaders.`

      content: `The UNDP of PRESMUN 2025 goes into a frenzy to try to address all factors of
gentrification, albeit being controlled, delegates are rushing into solution-based discussions.
UNDP PRESMUN 2025 (New York Times) – At around 9:00 AM (Western Indonesian
Time), delegates of the UNDP PRESMUN 2025 rush to find solutions in the council. During
the opening, many delegates had a uniform ‘call to action’, which is the call to action of unity
in proposing an economic stance in solving gentrification.

The topic of displacement was repeatedly brought up during the opening speeches.
Displacement of the lower class was the main topic of concern, leading to many delegates
pledging to find economic ways to not only reduce the impact of gentrification within
neighborhoods, but also find ways to increase the quality of life within lower-class
neighborhoods.

Delegates pitched in on already-made resolutions, such as point 11 of the SDGs was brought
up by the delegate of the United Kingdom. The delegate of Ireland proposed an ‘Urban
Development Quota’ where some areas are imposed a cap on the use of land. This quota will
help with efficiency whilst helping to reduce the amount of money that can be used for
gentrification.

At 10:08 am, an unmoderated caucus was agreed upon, so the delegates went around the
chamber, coming together to form different blocs. One was seen to be spearheaded by the
delegation of the United States, and the other by the delegation of Nigeria. A split of blocs
was agreed upon to focus on tackling gentrification based on the economic capability of each
country.

All and all, the UNDP council was hectic, many delegates came together to find a way to
tackle all factors of gentrification; however, in the end, the delegates understood it was better
to focus on tackling and limiting gentrification, based on each country’s economic capability.

      excerpt: "How technology transformed traditional Model UN into a hybrid experience that bridges physical and virtual diplomatic engagement.",
      content: `The United States proposed the Community Land Trust (CLT) model during today’s UNDP
Council session as a response to the growing displacement of urban populations in
developing countries. The proposal was particularly highlighted during discussions with
Tunisia, where both delegations exchanged perspectives on inclusive and equitable urban
development.

The CLT model, originally developed in the United States, is designed to prevent real estate
speculation by placing land under community ownership. This approach enables long-term
housing affordability and stability for marginalized populations.

The U.S. delegation emphasized the success of CLTs in cities such as Washington, an area
facing significant gentrification pressures and noted that since 2025, the implementation and
impact of CLTs have significantly improved within the U.S. itself.

Tunisia responded positively, expressing openness to adapting similar community-based
models tailored to their local context and indicated their intent to explore the concept further
in upcoming discussions.

This dialogue was part of the UNDP Council’s broader efforts to address the consequences of
gentrification, particularly across the Global South. As urban inequality continues to impact
vulnerable communities worldwide, models like the CLT are gaining attention as potential
tools for sustainable and socially just development.`

      content: `The delegates mentioned climate change as the biggest driver of sea level rise at the UNEP
conference on Saturday, 19 July. The delegates discussed the root causes and the past
actions of climate mitigation. Besides that, small island developing country (SIDS) and Asia-
Pacific countries are also being discussed in the conference.

The delegates said that each country has its own challenge, such as Netherlands that have
been geographically shaped by water, Indonesia as an archipelago country, and Maldives
that are etoll country are concern of the island submerging driven by sea level rise. Therefore,
the solutions must be discussed and considered by the whole country.

In a recent discussion, the delegate of Netherlands mentioned the high-emitting activities,
especially causes by high economies and highlighted the negative impacts that ASEAN and
Pacific country and other SIDS as sea level rise at-risk countries facing. More over, the
delegate of Netherland emphasized the blue economy market and focusing on minimum
carbon emission industries and activities. The Unites States’ delegate responded the
statement by an appeal to immediate and significant measures instead of mentioning the
past actions.`

      excerpt: "How technology transformed traditional Model UN into a hybrid experience that bridges physical and virtual diplomatic engagement.",
      content: `Long-term changes in weather patterns and temperatures are commonly referred to by the term
climate change. Changes in the sun's activity can cause these changes naturally. These result
from using coal to heat a building or gasoline to power a vehicle. The Earth is warming faster
than it has in at least two millennia due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) under the UN Council focused on the solution
of climate change globally.

In the UNEP meeting simulations, the delegates of any country raise their placard proudly to
propose their solutions. In the Moderated Caucus, the delegates of the Netherlands and delegates
of the United States are active to propose motions to solve these issues. The delegates of the
Netherlands said “Climate Change is in there too. Country allocated below sea level. Always
manage the water with innovations and protect. We need support from all countries to face this
crisis together.” This can be seen as the Netherlands seeking for international cooperations
among countries. In the GSL, the US is saying that the current solutions are not enough, also
need collaboration too. It can be seen that the US mentioned already joining the Paris
Agreement.

Especially in unmoderated caucus, there's such a perspective gap between the delegates of
Netherlands and the delegates of the United States. The US is negotiating that just one bloc
exists and trying to dominate other countries to become one bloc. Because the US delegate thinks
that climate change is the problem of all countries, so all countries must work together in one
block. But the Netherlands and China have a different perspective about making the bloc. The
Netherlands negotiated that there must be another bloc because each country has different
perspectives and problems. Many countries have their own national interests as well.
The UNEP simulation meeting showed contrasting views between the US and the Netherlands,
reflecting challenges in uniting countries with different interests to address climate change
effectively.`

      content: `UNEP's main topic revolves around each member's concern regarding climate change and biodiversity loss. Majority expresses their fear towards the 'sinking' of each nation as the result of prolonged climate change.

The council started off calm in the morning, with Bangladesh kickstarting the GSL. The council's attention is quickly averted towards China's strong speech, demanding the discussion of root causes and loopholes, which then caught the delegate of Netherland's interest in later motion.

USA, however, started to show arrogance once the unmoderated caucus unfolded, with the main topic of root causes, loopholes, and possible solutions. "We believe that everyone is facing the same issue, and that is why we propose for us to be one bloc.", delegate of USA said. This proposal rapidly raises disagreements across the discussion circle, where China steps in for a rebuttal towards USA's statement, along with Netherlands. "It's not effective.", says the delegate of Netherlands.

"Not every country faces the same issue,", China said, "and by putting everyone in the same bloc, it'll be a struggle for us to differentiate each state's problem.". Delegate of Brazil, agreeing with China, added, "We can't fully cut gas emissions, because it occurs daily and the usage ofgas is necessary in today's civilization." Later on, the council split into two respectful groups, EU and G77 members.

The second moderated caucus lead into a more comprehensive discussion, such as the strengthening of global resilience and capacity building assist for developing countries. Delegate of USA, once again, tried to test China's stance (and possibly patience), by criticizing their 'half-hearted' effort on repairing coastal lines, that there has been no significant progress since the start.

"It's pretty difficult to work alongside USA with different economy strategies.", China answered when asked about the possibility of collaboration with USA during an interview.`

      excerpt: "How technology transformed traditional Model UN into a hybrid experience that bridges physical and virtual diplomatic engagement.",
      content: `Indonesia as a country with thousands of islands, mangroves, and rainforests, is in the forefront of
ecological danger as the climate crisis worsens. Climate action is urgently needed because of the
threat that rising sea levels pose to its coastal people and the loss of biodiversity in its most
abundant ecosystems.

However, despite many promises of billions in climate money from international forums, aid to
weaker developing countries like Indonesia continues to be delayed, unequal, and frequently
linked to complex circumstances. This begs the important question of whether global climate
finance systems are indeed intended to assist those in greatest need or if they are instead serving
to exacerbate the very disparities that the climate movement aims to address.

Although billions of dollars in climate finance are frequently promised at international meetings,
the real flow of money to nations like Indonesia is still small. Despite playing a crucial role in
biodiversity and global carbon storage, Indonesia has difficulty getting timely and equitable
support. According to recent interview with the delegate of Indonesia, When it comes to how
accessible climate finance is for Indonesia, the answer is only partially accessible.

It is true that Indonesia has received some funding, such as the Green Climate Fund for some
projects like REDD+ results-based payments in 2019 where Indonesia received 103.8 million USD
for reducing emissions from deforestation. Indonesia also received a lot of aid such as the Forest
Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) from the World Bank, UN-REDD, Norway's NICFI, and
bilateral agreements with Germany, Japan, and others.

Despite they have received the financial aid, it is not enough. For example, FOLU Net Sink
program 2023, one of the main features of which is to address the Jakarta Sinking problem, the
funding needs are around 204 trillion Rupiah (13 Billion USD), but the Indonesian government
funding for the 2020-2024 time period is only around 19.6 trillion, far from the funding needs.
Although Indonesia has received 1 Trillion from Norway under the Results-Based Contribution
(RBC-5), the gap between the required funds and the existing funds is still very large.

Indonesia is among the 35 countries most vulnerable to climate change, with major risks from
rising sea levels, extreme weather and biodiversity loss. Yet so far, Indonesia has received various
types of assistance, but the gap is still very large. It is estimated that Indonesia needs around 281
billion USD to implement its declared NDC. However, current international contributions cover
less than 20% of the need. The delegate said that distribution of climate fund is unfair. Many
developing countries like Indonesia have pledged 100 billion USD per year by 2020, but have
never met these targets in full or on time.`

      excerpt: "How technology transformed traditional Model UN into a hybrid experience that bridges physical and virtual diplomatic engagement.",
      content: `UNDP: The world is facing big problems like gentrification and urban displacement. These are
not new issues, but the way we solve them often feels old and slow. In the recent UNDP session,
it became clear that we need something more than just reports and long debates.

One of the main problems discussed in the council was about money. The United States said UNDP
projects cost too much and asked for clear plans. Other countries tried to balance between
economic growth and social equality. But the conversation started to feel stuck, until Norway
changed everything.

In a surprising moment, the delegate of Norway stood up, tore a piece of paper, and said, “Our
time is limited and we need fast solutions.” Then they gave a bold idea: creating something called
“UN POPS” a modern platform to raise money and support from the youth. Norway ended the
speech by saying, “Modern problem, modern solution,” while hitting the table.

This strong move was supported by Tunisia, showing that some countries are ready to try new
ideas. Instead of talking only about slow policies, they want fast action and creative thinking.

Arab News believes that this moment shows something important: diplomacy needs to change. We
are living in a fast world, but many diplomats still act too slow. Some countries like China or the
ones who choose to stay quiet are missing the chance to lead. Saying nothing is not the same as
being wise. Others countries such as U.S, Ireland, and more already shown they can lead with
smart ideas, like Vision 2030 and big urban projects. So why not do the same in diplomacy? We at
Arab News call for fresh solutions. Delegates must stop waiting and start acting. Let’s bring ideas
that are new, exciting, and fast just like the world we live in today.`

the unmoderated caucus. “We’re one great big country,”, USA stated during an interview, “we
are twice of China’s GDP. That’s why everyone relies on us.”

This scenario gives us the glimpse and the image of USA wanting to be the ‘one-and-only
saviour’ for every member country. China stance, on the other hand, believes that USA’s
delegate’s idea was ‘unrealistic’ and would be a struggle to achieve, due to every country having
more than one problems, and none shares the same two.

Netherlands agreed along with the Eastern, although both eventually split up into EU and G77
member groups.

During the crisis, two of three said countries were alleged with some controversial actions. USA
exporting its waste to developing countries, and Netherlands, being naïve while also facing
homicide allegations of some NGOs chairmen.

USA strengthens its MAGA movement by transporting trash to other countries
“We’re allocating our waste to developing countries so they can manage it, while we focus on
other important matters.”, USA clarified.

When asked for clarification during the press session, USA has shown their primordiality once
again, by saying “no” when asked whether they care or not about the wellbeing of the countries
they exported their waste to. No further clarification were added.

Netherlands, on the other hand, stood up for their Prime Minister as if hiding the truth, or simply
just ignorant. Saying, there has been no concrete proof nor validity of the accused file, as much
as they’re just assumptions.

China seemed subtly calm when two other delegates were fighting for the good sake of their
country. The delegation clarifies, “Not in any way, for now.”, when demanded information
regarding fostering a collaboration with USA, Netherlands, and other EU member countries.

While China tried to regain everyone’s trust back in the G77 group, the member delegates bias’
is unclear and remains unstable.`

      author: "Wa Ode Nesha Rahmadinah",
      date: "July 19, 2025",
      readTime: "3 min read",
      excerpt: "How technology transformed traditional Model UN into a hybrid experience that bridges physical and virtual diplomatic engagement.",
      content: `The United States took the stage at the UNDP Council with compelling rhetoric, proposing a
motion titled “The Impact of Gentrification on Minority Communities.” Their solution? The
Community Land Trust (CLT) is a model designed to ensure community land ownership and
resist displacement. The idea, promoted with confidence, was even offered to countries like
Tunisia and Ethiopia as a scalable solution for inclusive urban development. Moreover,
countries like Norway and Japan are also open to this. But behind the façade of progressive
diplomacy lies a disturbing contradiction.

In its cities, the U.S. continues to witness the unchecked displacement of Black, Latino, and
Indigenous communities. Gentrification in urban centers like New York, San Francisco, and
Washington, D.C. has become a symbol of systemic failure, not innovation. Community Land
Trusts, though promising, remain scarce, underfunded, and politically sidelined. How can a
nation export a model that hasn’t yet worked within its borders? This contradiction raises a
deeper question: Is this genuine global solidarity, or another extension of urban
neocolonialism under the flag of development?

The U.S. narrative becomes even more complex when seen through the lens of city
diplomacy and urban transnationalism. Cities are no longer passive arenas of development;
they are actors. They now participate in international policymaking, shape global norms, and,
increasingly, dictate what “progress” should look like in the Global South.

But if urban diplomacy becomes a new mode of influence, who benefits?

In this conference, Ethiopia has openly aligned itself with the U.S. stance. This may seem
like a sign of South–North cooperation. But history urges caution. When dominant powers
offer “solutions,” too often those come with conditions, whether explicit or implicit. Cities in
the Global South may be asked to adopt Western models of development without the power
to negotiate terms that fit their unique sociopolitical realities.

The danger is clear: the Global South could once again become a testing ground for ideas
not fully tested in the Global North. Tunisia, a country still healing from revolutionary
transitions, may soon carry the burden of implementing a model that is not even common in
the country proposing it. If the U.S. truly wants to lead on urban equity, it must begin by
confronting its contradictions. Global leadership cannot be built on unfinished business at
home. Progress begins not in the export of models, but in the humility to learn from one’s
failures.

A "Pop" Solution to a Structural Crisis?

The U.S., along with Norway and Japan, unveiled a joint initiative to create a funding
mechanism backed by what they called UNPOP — a musical and cultural platform aimed at
engaging youth around issues of urban injustice. Norway delegates states that“Modern
problems require modern solutions.”

Engaging youth through culture is admirable. But music does not build affordable housing.
Soundtracks don’t rewrite discriminatory zoning laws. And pop campaigns won’t secure land
rights for informal settlers in Tunis or Addis Ababa. While cultural engagement is important,
cultural diplomacy without structural investment is just rebranding, not reform.`
